OPEN CV 

Image processing and Computer vision
    i) Image formation (image formation is always in reverse way)
   ii) pinhole camera and perspective camera   

Digital Image
    i) Sampling -> a spatial resolution -> continious image project onto a sensor array
   ii) Quantization -> number of grey levels -> result of image sampling and quantization
    camera level depends on level of quantization
    after quantization for every shade some specific color and color is saved and there will be lets say 8x8 matrix so 256 shades 0-255 and each block will be assigned with some block of color. More the shade more the quality

Computer vision -> Field of computer science that focuses on enabling computer to identify and understand objects and people in images and videos 

Computer vision capabilities
    i) Object classification
   ii) Object Identification
  iii) Object tracking
   iv) Object character recognition
