Time Complexity
//Liner search 
operation : Access item and compare
N : size of element to be checked 
Time complexity : O(N)
TIme complexity is also consered about how many operations per input element

step1: Always find relaiton between N (number) of input items and operation where "operation" is context specific

e.g in linear search operation is "access element and compare"
in binary search, check middle, if found okay else divide
