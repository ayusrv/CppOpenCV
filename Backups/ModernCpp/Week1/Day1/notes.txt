Abstraaction -> Not providing the implemantation delatils so that
    a) It can be probided at a later point in the code hierarchy
    b) We can exmplain functionality without significant focus on implemantation details

Inheritance -> Either you specialize the implementation for a specific subcategory or
                You develop logic which can be genralized to many types

Polumorphism -> 

Encapsulation ->

Composition 

Aggregation

Association
