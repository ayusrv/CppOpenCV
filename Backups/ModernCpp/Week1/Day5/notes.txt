#encapsulation : Hide the internal representation of the object from any party/ entity/ 
                line of code outside the class.
                you can use data binding to achiece this by simply providing member functions 
                as layer between data and outside world. 


#data binding : The concept of relating/binding member functions with data members
                if you are putting a function inside a class that function atleast 
                access one data member of that class


#Abstration : HIding the implementation detail of a behavious(function so that)
                    a) It allows programmers to reimplement a functionalituy in a different way
                        down the class hierarchy by overriding in child classes                    
                    b) by using abstraction we can talk in "ABSTRACT" terms while explaning behaviour

#VIRTUAL AND PURE VIRTUAL

    Scenario 1: I want to model some data. Bind members with accessible data members and perform basic operations
                -Create a simple calsses
                -Bind data members with memeber functions. Keep all data private.

    Scenario 2: I want to create tyoes and subrypes so that I can generalizw opreralizes or implement specific solutions for
                specific sub categories. 

            create a parent class and apropriate child classes. Then sk the following questions    
                a) are all methos implemented in all calsses?
                    if yes no need for pure virtual functions 
                b) are we going to cretae objects of multiple child classes and store them together in the same container?
                    if yeas, we need to use upcasting.
                    base class methods must be marked as virtual
                c) Do we need to make the base class abstract/ Do we need to prevent initialization (object creating for abse class?)
                        -Make sure at least 1 method in the parent is mared as pure virtual 
                d) I am not sure if methond will be overriden. May be in future but no sure currently
                    -Make as virtual 



Tips to write programs:
    1) Read the problem statement completely twice atleast before doing any thing 
    2) Header gaurd, compile program only when it is fully completed!
    3) Always work on individual functions only.
        Breakdown entire solutions into small small sections!
    4) Always draw a diagram 
    5) Spend more time in designing the solution for each functionalities rather than implementing it 


Create a banking system where I can record customer details, card details, acc details and cheque details
Acc may have sub categorie

expected operations are abality to cretae new account,
find details of an account based on ID, calculate min, max, total or average account balance 
print details of cheque based on chaeque number


ClassA{
    ...
    ...

    public:
        virtual void Display(){
            std::Cout<<"A Display\n";
        }
        void Test(){
            std::cout<<"A test\n";
        }
}


ClassB : public classA{
    ...
    ...

    public:
        void display(){
            std::Cout<<"B Display\n";
        }
        void test(){
            std::cout<<"B test\n";
        }
}

Rule1: for a class that contains at aleast 1 virtual method
    A virtual table is created i memory. 
    This table has addresses for the virtual methods functions 

Rule2: If a class inherits from a parent class that also contains a vtable, 
    the child will also implement its own vtable

A* ptr = new B();
ptr->Display();
    Step1 -> verify where is Display();
    -go to class wose type is ptr's type 
    -go to A class. Verify whether this function 
    is at least declared in class A 
    Step2 -> Verify is the method is non virtual. If yes, call the function 
        if the function is virtual, proceed to step 3
    Step 3: Now find the type of RHS(Object type). FInd the vtable for object and call function based ON ENTRY IN VTABLE 



classA VTable 
[A::Display()::0X10045H]
0X777H
[vptr] -> that address is vptr 



Casting logic 
    POINTER IS OF PARENT TYPE 
        1: I want to call function fn. fn exits in the parent and also exits in the child 
        but fn is non-virtual 
        you can use ptr->fn() //This will call parent call fn 
        if you want to call child do DYNAMIC_CAST into child 

        2: I want to call function fn. fn exits in the parent and does not exits in the child 
        and fn is non-virtual
        you can use ptr->fn() //This will call parent fn 
        YOU SHOULD NOT USE DYNAMIC_CAST BECAUSE FN DOES NOT EXIST IN THE CHILD 

        3: I want to call function fn. fn exits in the child and does not exits in the parent 
        and fn is non-virtual 
        PARENT POINTER IS PRACTICALLY USELESS 
        YOU HAVE TO USE DYNAMIC_CAST 

        4: I want to call function fn. fn exits in the parent and also exits in the child 
        and fn is virtual
        compiler will call the most derived version of fn FROM THE INHERITANCE HIERARCHY  


Lets talk about some errors -> Read errors from top to bottom 
    1) <Identifier> not declared in scope
        -Function name being used doest not appear in declared symbols
        -Variable declared does not appear in available names
        -Data passing ya function passing mai kuch gadbad hua hai
    2) Undefined reference to a function 
        -done declaration but body/defination/implementation is missing 
    3) Multiple defination <functionName>
        -defined the function twice  
    4) Multiple defination/ redefination of class <className>
        - bina header gaurd ka 2 baar .h ko include kr diye kahi pe 
    5) too few arguments to function <functionName> 
        - km arguments pass kiye ho
    6) too few arguments to function <functionName> 
        - jayda arguments pass kr dye ho 
    7) arguments mismatch
        - manga kuch arguments hai vej kuch or rahe hai function mai 
    8) no matching function error call
        - the parameter you have passed for calling the function, 
            those paramerters are different from the actual parameters in the function
