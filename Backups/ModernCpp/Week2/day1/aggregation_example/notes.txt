If you take pointer of calssB in classA we say that classA is composed with classB as a member
If you take reference of classBin classA we say classA is aggregated with classB 

Composition -> If calssA object is destroyed, attached classB object is also supposed to be Destroyed
Aggregation -> If classA object is destroyed, attached classB object is not get destroyed
