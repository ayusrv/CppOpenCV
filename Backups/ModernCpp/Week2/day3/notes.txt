    Function Wrapper -> way to capture any callable in a type erased way
        - It can be used for the following
            - Pass a calable as a parameter
            - Return a callable
            - Save functions as "values" in container/ variables
    
    Reference Wrapper -> Object that internally stroes reference "reference to something"
                        It uses pointer to reference conversion internally
                        It can be replacement for raw reference everywhere in code
                        Rvalues cannot be converted to reference wrapper 

    std::bind -> It creates a partial function
                    A function some oarameters are already fixed
                    It also allows you to redesign or tweak the sequence of parameters by swapping or repositioning them as per req
